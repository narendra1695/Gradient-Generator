## Introduction 

We all have seen the awesome gradient styling patterns on various websites.

This website acts as a demonstration for styling different elements on any website with gradients. Using this website one can actually see the desirable combination of two different colors on screen.

## Working

Javascript plays the key role in this project.

Using the DOM manipulation principle, one can select any color from the windows color palette and eventually set the color as the gradient color 1 as well as gradient color 2.

Both the colors together will given us a nice gradient look and feel (considering that the colors choosen will be good).
